# IR-Latent-semantic-indexing

Repository for the project of the course "Information Retrieval" of the master degree "Data Science and Scientific Computing" @UniTS.

For the project I needed to implement the following tasks:

- Write an IR system that uses latent semantic indexing to answer queries.
- The system must accept free-form text queries.
- Evaluate the system on a set of queries…
- …and try to use different dimensions for the dimensionality reduction.
